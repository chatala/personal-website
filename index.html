            <div class="el__text">Hello, thank you for coming to my website! My name is Catherine Hatala, and I am a recent 2020 graduate of UC Berkeley. I recieved a BA in Cognitive Science with a focus in computational modeling. From my first computer science class in high school, I knew that you could accomplish some pretty incredible things with coding. After getting to college, my eyes were opened even wider with what I could do with it, and I fell in love with the interdisciplinary aspect of the cognitive science major- epsecially its inclusion of many data science classes. Fun facts and interesting figures about my random interests (feel free to check these out on my Interests Tab) were always something I loved to know. Now, with the skillset I have developed from past experiences and projects, I can find them out for myself.
            <br>
            <br>
            Originally born and raised on Long Island, NY, I decided to move across the country to pursue my dream of living in California in order to attend UC Berkeley. Now, I am a total west coast convert and am fully enjoying the active lifestyle. I love to go running in the Marina, hiking in Marin, and exploring all over the San Fransisco/Bay Area. Otherwise (COVID-19 permitting), you can find me traveling across the country to visit friends, or getting yelled at by the Duolinguo Owl to practice my daily Russian lesson.</div>

A seed must be inserted and each unique seed is a different world. Used a tile rendering engine that took in a 2d array, made sure it was in bounds, and then added halls, rooms, objects, floors, and walls.
